# Database-Design

Using Oracle Database, I designed, implemented a database “backend” solution for Volunteer information database for a Charter school.

I provided the following:
• Conceptual data models (i.e., ERDs, etc.)
• Schema(s) and normalized tables
• Populated data in tables
• Technical Manual (report) for DB backend

I designed and developed a “front-end interface” (i.e.,Forms and Reports), for a student loan program.

Deliverables for this segment of the project included the following:
• Case description
• Combination Technical and User Manual (including screenshots) with full narrative
about the Forms/Reports that comprise the user interface.
• A 10-15 minute “training video” (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) that demos the completed
database solution. Be sure to include clear narration in the video.
